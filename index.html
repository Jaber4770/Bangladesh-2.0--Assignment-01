            <div class="yunus-quote">
                <p>Each of us has unlimited potential, and our ability to unleash this potential depends on the
                    opportunities and support we receive. Poverty is not created by the poor; it is created by the
                    systems,
                    institutions, and policies we have designed. We must create a world where no one is left behind,
                    where
                    businesses exist for social impact, not just profit. The goal of social business is to solve
                    problems,
                    empower communities, and build sustainable systems. Wealth concentration is a global issue; we need
                    to
                    democratize opportunities. By empowering women and marginalized groups, we create pathways to growth
                    and
                    prosperity. The power of one person to change the world is infinite. Dreams fuel action, and action
                    transforms lives. A sustainable future begins with shared responsibility, innovation, and the
                    courage to
                    challenge norms.</p>
